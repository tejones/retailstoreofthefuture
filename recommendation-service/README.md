# Recommendation Service

This service creates MQTT consumers to listen to "entry event" and "focus event".

**Entry event** is generated (externally), whenever a customer enters the store.

**Focus event** is generated (externally), whenever the platform detects, that a customer has stopped in a given
department (he is probably interested in buying some goods from that department).

This service's responsibility is to:

* fetch customer context (purchase history, demographics, etc.) from "the central" (datacenter), when the service
  receives *entry event*
* invoke/call prediction service to decide if the customer is willing to use coupons from a given department,
  when the service receives *focus event* and sends the prediction result to a dedicated MQTT topic.

## Prediction request 
In order to do the actual prediction, a REST call is made.

**TBD**
(See: [prediction.schema.json](schema/prediction.schema.json))

# Development

## Dependencies

Dependencies of the project are contained in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file. All the packages are publicly
available.

All the packages can be installed with:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Service configuration

The service reads the following **environment variables**:

| Variable                | Description                          | Default |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------:|
| MQTT_HOST               | comma-separated list of MQTT brokers |       - |
| MQTT_PORT               | MQTT brokers' port                   |    	  - |
| MQTT_USERNAME           | MQTT user username                   |    None |
| MQTT_PASSWORD           | MQTT user password                   |    None |
| MQTT_BROKER_CERT_FILE   | path to MQTT ssl cert file           |    None |
| MQTT_CLIENT_ID          | MQTT client ID prefix                |  recSvc |
| ENTER_TOPIC             | topic for entry events               |       - |
| FOCUS_TOPIC             | topic for focus events               |       - |
| COUPON_PREDICTION_TOPIC | topic for sending prediction results |       - |
| LOG_LEVEL               | logging level                        |    INFO |
| LOG_FILENAME            | log file name                        |      '' |

(Parameters with `-` in the "Default" column are required.)

Use env variables [log_config.py](./app/config/log_config.py) to **configure logging behaviour**.
By default, console is used for logging. File handler is added if `LOG_FILENAME` is provided.


## Running the service

For development, I created a project with a dedicated virtual environment (Python 3.8, all the dependencies installed
there).

The code reads sensitive information (tokens, secrets) from environment variables. They need to be set accordingly in
advance.
`.environment.variables.sh` can be used for that purpose. Then, in order to run the service the following commands can be
used:

```bash
$ . .environment.variables.sh
$ . venv/bin/activate
(venv)$ uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --reload --reload-dir app
```
> Please, note `reload-dir` switch. Without it the reloader goes into an infinite loop because it detects log file changes (messages.log).

## Testing without MQTT
For testing purposes, there are two endpoints that simulate events ("entry event", "focus event"),
as if they would appear on a dedicated MQTT topic.

In order for the service not to create real MQTT consumers and producers,
set `TESTING_NO_MQTT` environment variable to "true".

This way, event processing logic can be tested without MQTT, for example:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/mock_entry' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"id": "127", "ts": 192322800}'
```

or:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/mock_focus' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"id": "127", "ts": 192322800, "dep": "Boys"}'
```

## Docker image
The docker image for the service is [Dockerfile](Dockerfile).
In order to build the image use:

```bash
docker build -t recommendation-service:0.0.1 .
```

> Set image name (`recommendation-service`) and tag (`0.0.1`) according to
> your needs.

To run the service as a Docker container run:

```bash
docker run -d -e LOG_LEVEL="warning"  --name recommendaition-service recommendation-service:0.0.1
```

## Mock event endpoints
For testing purposes, there are two endpoints that simulate events ("entry event", "focus event"),
as if they would appear on a dedicated MQTT topic.

This way, event processing logic can be tested without MQTT, for example:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/mock_entry' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"id": "127", "ts": 192322800}'
```

or:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/mock_focus' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"id": "127", "ts": 192322800, "dep": "Boys"}'
```
